List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE(SDLC) CONSISTS CONSISTS OF SEVERAL PHASES WHICH INCLUDES;
1. Feasibility study: this is the initiation stage of project.it helps in deciding whether a project should be undertaking.it can be economic,technical or operational feasibity
2. Requirements: During this phase, users requirements are studied and analysed. Which are to be used in software development process.
3. Implementation or development: This is the phase where whole of the system is develped,it encompass the coding processses and standards.the coding standards talks about some of the following guidlines; name of module, documentation in source code and history of modification made in modules.
4. Testing: This is the important phase of software development life cycle. herr the developing application is been tested for various situation and environment and changing preposition.Here, performance ,reliability and robustnesss are put under thorogh examination. the testing is performed in various levels for exam;ples, unit level,module level,subsystem level and system level.it can be tested in either black box or white box test cases.
5. Deployment: The new develped system is handed over to the customer along with relevant documentation.The old system is dispensed the new system is installed for operation and use.training is provided to the user group to use and manage the new system.
6. Maintenance: this involves providing ongoing support and ,updates and enhancements to the software after develpment.
